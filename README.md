# API Quickstart

This repository includes the source code for a C# .NET console application that demonstrates how to interact with the API using an HTTP client.

The best place to start is the Bearer Authentication Demo in the src/cli folder. This example shows how to authenticate using a JWT bearer token, make API calls, and process responses for groups, user accounts, and gradebooks. The API provides much more, of course. The source code here is intended as an example only, to help you get started working with the API.

> Please note this quickstart applies to version 2 of the API for Shift iQ.
